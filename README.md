# "Powerful Cli Applications in Go" Workspace

This isn't a "real" project in the sense that it accepts PRs or should be used or forked by anyone as a real application.

This is my workspace for learing concepts from the book.

This is also my "notebook" on how to do things in Go or how to manage a Go project.
